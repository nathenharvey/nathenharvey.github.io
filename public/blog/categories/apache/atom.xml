<h2>Discuss Chef Solo vs. Chef Server</h2>

<p>Chef Solo allows you to run Chef Cookbooks without a Chef Server.  There are a number of things that you don't get when using Chef Solo.  Check the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo">Chef Solo page on the wiki</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Download a number of cookbooks from the community site</h2>

<p>Now that we've got our Vagrant instance connected to Chef Server we can start managing the configuration of the VM with Chef.  We'll download a number of cookbooks from the <a href="http://community.opscode.com">Community Site</a> and extract them into our Chef repository.</p>

<p>Here are the commands we ran to download each cookbook:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download apache2</code></li>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download apt</code></li>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download build-essentials</code></li>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download mongodb</code></li>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download omnibus_updater</code></li>
<li><code>knife cookbook site download passenger_apache2</code></li>
</ol>


<p>After downloading each cookbook, extract it to the cookbooks directory of the chef-repo:</p>

<p><code>tar xzvf COOKBOOK_NAME.tar.gz -C cookbooks</code></p>

<p>Finally, upload each cookbook to the Hosted Chef server:</p>

<p><code>knife cookbook upload COOKBOOK_NAME</code></p>

<h2>Update the run list for our node</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways to update a node's run list.  You can do so in a web browser while logged in to Hosted Chef or you can do so using knife.</p>

<p>In our session, we used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_S-yxKfYek&amp;t=18m47s">the management interface</a> and <code>knife node edit</code> there's an even easier way with knife though:</p>

<p><code>knife node run_list add NODE_NAME RUN_LIST_ITEM</code> which we would have done as <code>knife node run_list add patrick_vm "recipe[passenger_apache2]"</code></p>

<p>Once our run list has been updated, we run <code>vagrant provision</code> to execute chef-client on our VM.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/K_S-yxKfYek?start=1885" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Add port forwarding to the Vagrant instance</h2>

<p>Finally, we updated our Vagrant configuration so that port 80 on the VM is forwarded to port 8080.  This was done by adding <code>config.vm.forward_port 80, 8080</code> to our Vagrantfile.  Here's the full Vagrantfile:</p>

<p>``` ruby Vagrantfile
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "opscode-ubuntu-12.04"
  config.vm.box_url = "https://opscode-vm.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/boxes/opscode-ubuntu-12.04.box"
  config.vm.forward_port 80, 8080</p>

<p>  config.vm.provision :chef_client do |chef|</p>

<pre><code>chef.chef_server_url = "https://api.opscode.com/organizations/fidor"
chef.validation_key_path = "./.chef/fidor-validator.pem"
chef.validation_client_name = "fidor-validator"
chef.node_name = "patrick_vm"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Stay tuned for our next session where we'll start exploring <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html">resources</a> and writing our own <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbooks.html">cookbooks</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You've heard of Chef, Puppet, and other frameworks that can help you build out your infrastructure. You've been meaning to play around with one or more of them for some time now. Now's your chance; Start cooking up on your own servers!</p>

<p>In this presentation, I provide an introduction to Chef with a focus on what you'll need to know to get a Rails application up and running.</p>

<p>Topics include:
  * Introduction to Chef
  * Nodes, roles, environments, and other terminology
  * Introduction to cookbooks
  * Provisioning an environment for a Rails application
  * Deploying with Capistrano</p>

<p>You won't be ready to compete in Iron Chef, but you will be ready to serve up your own Rails environment in no time.</p>

<p>I gave slightly different versions of this presentation at <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation 2012</a> and <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate any comments, questions, or feedback in the comments section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>, we recently migrated from mongrel to Passenger for our Ruby on Rails website. This migration included a full rewrite of our apache configuration files.</p>

<p>With over 500 redirect and rewrite rules in place I needed a way to ensure my copy-n-paste skills were up to snuff and that we didn't loose any redirects along the way.</p>

<p>In my search for help, I found a <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/test-drive-mod-rewrite-rules-with-testunit/">blog post by Patrick Reagan from Viget labs</a> that described a method for writing tests that will verify all the rewrite rules and redirects. Patrick's ideas were packaged up into a gem and available on <a href="http://github.com/eightbitraptor/http_redirect_test">github</a>.</p>

<p>I can now write up tests like:</p>

<p><code>ruby
should_redirect "/cink/ideas/ideas.jsp", :to =&gt; "/inspiration/"
</code></p>

<p>So now I can to some TDC (test-driven configuration) whenever I get a request for a new redirect.</p>

<p>What other methods have you used to test your rewrite rules?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently migrated a site from mongrel to passenger. Today I learned that the wordpress site that was served up by the same webserver wasn't working anymore.</p>

<p>Compared the configurations and everything looked OK, no changes were made as part of the migration. PHP module was being loaded, URL was being properly aliased, etc. Watched my logs and saw that Passenger was attempting to serve up the request which is not what I wanted.</p>

<p>A quick update to my Directory's definition and the issue was fixed. I had to explicitly disable Passenger using <code>PassengerEnabled off</code> as seen below:</p>

<p>``` apache
  Alias /blog /shared/www/blog
  <Directory /shared/www/blog></p>

<pre><code>DirectoryIndex index.php 
PassengerEnabled off
</code></pre>

<p>  </Directory>
```</p>
