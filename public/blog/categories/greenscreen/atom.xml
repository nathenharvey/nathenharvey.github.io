    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>, I gave a presentation on how the <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> web operations team enables developer productivity.</p>

<p>There's always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we've made to our teams, processes and tools.</p>

<p>Presenting at RailsConf was a really enjoyable experience and the presentation was well received.  There were lots of questions from the audience after the presentation.  Unfortunately, the Q &amp; A section was not captured in the video.  I'd really appreciate any questions or feedback you have, just drop a comment below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">previous post</a>, I introduced <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">Green Screen</a>, a build monitoring tool that is designed to be used as a dynamic Big Visible Chart (BVC) in your work area.  It lets you add links to your build servers and displays the largest possible information on a monitor so that the team can see the build status from anywhere in the room.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to get <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">Green Screen</a> up and running on your own server or VM. The project's <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen/blob/master/README.md">README</a> includes all the information you'll need for doing so. In this post, I'll describe the steps necessary to run Green Screen on Heroku or on your own server using Chef.</p>

<h2>Deploying to Heroku</h2>

<p>Deploying to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is probably the easiest way to get up and running with Green Screen. You'll need a Heroku account but a free one should be sufficient. Check the <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">quick start guide</a> if you don't yet have an account.</p>

<p>Once you've got your Heroku account set-up, simply follow these steps to get your Green Screen app deployed:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:customink/greenscreen.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd greenscreen</code></li>
<li><code>gem install heroku</code></li>
<li><code>heroku create</code></li>
<li><code>git push heroku master</code></li>
<li><code>heroku open</code></li>
</ol>


<p>If your build servers are running on the Internet, Heroku may be all that you need.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong> this default Green Screen looks at all of the builds currently running on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org">http://ci.jenkins-ci.org</a>.  This is fine for demo purposes but you may find it to be a bit overwhelming since it's <strong>over 300 builds</strong> at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>You can see a sample of this app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a></p>

<h2>Deploying with Chef</h2>

<p>If your build servers are not publicly accessible, Heroku won't be a great option. <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> has published a <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/greenscreen">Chef cookbook</a> for setting up Green Screen on one of your nodes.</p>

<p>You simply need to include the greenscreen recipe to install, configure, and run one or more GreenScreen applications.  Or add it to your role, or directly to a node's recipes.</p>

<p><code>ruby
include_recipe "greenscreen"
</code></p>

<p>Of course, if you're just getting started with Chef, you should look at <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> which is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments. With Vagrant, you can quickly spin-up a VM in <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and have it use the greenscreen cookbook.</p>

<p>The cookbook allows you to specify credentials and jobs to include or ignore with each server and allows you to set-up multiple Green Screens on the same node. At CustomInk, we use different Green Screen applications for different teams.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt from one of our Chef environment files:</p>

<p>``` ruby
"greenscreens" => [
  {</p>

<pre><code>:name =&gt; "greenscreen",
:port =&gt; "4567",
:servers =&gt; [
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build01.customink.office:8080/cc.xml"
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build02.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password"
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build03.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password",
    :ignore_jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  {</p>

<pre><code>:name =&gt; "greenscreen.webops",
:port =&gt; "4568",
:servers =&gt; [
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build03.customink.office:8080/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "hudson",
    :password =&gt; "hudson_password",
    :jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]
  },
  {
    :url =&gt; "http://build04.customink.office/cc.xml",
    :username =&gt; "jenkins",
    :password =&gt; "jenkis_password"
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>  }
]
```</p>

<p>With this configuration, we have 2 Green Screens running, on ports 4567 and 4568. Both are polling build servers and showing different jobs. For instance, the server on 4567 excludes the www_redirects build (<code>:ignore_jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]</code>) whereas the server on 4568 only includes this build (<code>:jobs =&gt; ["www_redirects"]</code>) when polling the build03 server.</p>

We use Green Screen at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> to look after our continuous integration servers, currently 3 Hudson servers and one Jenkins cluster. We have a monitor mounted in the engineering office that makes it easy for everyone to quickly assess the build status.</p>

<p>Green Screen is a simple Sinatra application that is <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">easy to configure and deploy</a>.  It works well with any continuous integration server that conforms to the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CI/Multiple+Project+Summary+Reporting+Standard">multiple project summary reporting standard</a>.</p>

<p>You can see a sample Green Screen app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a>.  Be forewarned, this sample Green Screen looks at all of the builds currently running on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org">http://ci.jenkins-ci.org</a>.  This is fine for demo purposes but you may find it to be a bit overwhelming since it's <strong>over 300 builds</strong> at the time of this writing.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Green Screen was originally implemented by <a href="https://github.com/martinjandrews">Marty Andrews</a> and <a href="http://blog.martyandrews.net/2009/08/greenscreen-build-monitor-bvc.html">announced on his blog in 2009</a>. In the original version, a build that was in progress would blink on the screen.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4565_building.jpg" width="208" height="145" title="martinjandrews Green Screen" alt="martinjandrews Green Screen"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rsutphin">Rhett Sutphin</a> improved the layout of green screen and introduced a new color, yellow, for builds that are in progress.
<a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4566-building.jpg" width="207" height="145" title="rsutphin Green Screen" alt="rsutphin Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>After using these versions for a while at CustomInk, we decided that the most important thing to know was which builds were failing. Once you get past a handful of builds, it's no longer very interesting to see every build. We forked Rhett's version and created a <a href="https://github.com/customink/greenscreen">new layout for Green Screen</a>.</p>

<p>If everything is passing, the screen is basically one giant checkmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/green.jpg" width="210" height="119" title="customink Green Screen" alt="customink Green Screen"></a></p>

<p>If there are any failing builds, they're shown in the main area while all others are displayed on the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink failed build" alt="customink failed build"></a></p>

<p>Finally, a build that previously failed will be shown in yellow while it's rebuilding.</p>

<p><a href="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/greenscreen/4567_building.jpg" width="210" height="121" title="customink building" alt="customink building">
</a>
We've also added support for controlling which builds are displayed from each CI server. So that you can explicitly include or exclude builds or just go with the default behavior of showing all builds on the server.</p>

<h2>Deploying</h2>

<p>I'll cover a couple of deployment options for Green Screen in my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">next post</a>.</p>
