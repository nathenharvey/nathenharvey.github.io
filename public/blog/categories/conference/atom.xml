    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started working with Chef, there were a couple of areas that I knew were going to be really awesome and helpful but I wasn't sure how to get started with them.  In this presentation, I'll provide a quick introduction to five things you've always wanted to know about Chef but were afraid to ask.</p>

<p>I gave this presentation at <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Level-up your Chef skills by learning about these areas of Chef:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Attribute Precedence</strong> - Role, environment, cookbook, data bag? Which attribute value will be used in my chef run?</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Databags</strong> - Chef 0.10 brought us encrypted databags. We'll look at how to create and use databags and how to keep them up-to-date in your repository.</li>
<li><strong>LWRP</strong> - What is a LWRP? How and why do you create one? We'll look at a couple of sample LWRPs and learn how to build a simple one.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handlers</strong> - Demystify exception and report handlers by writing a simple one and seeing examples of how they work in the wild.</li>
<li><strong>Capistrano and Chef</strong> - Take a quick look at why and how to integrate Chef search into your Capistrano configuration to make deploying your Rails apps even easier.</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing I didn't mention in the presentation was how to use the data from the encrypted data bag.  I've updated the slides to include this info but it doesn't appear in the video.  In any case, here's a quick demo of how you might use it:</p>

<p>``` ruby
creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("db", "creds")
env_db_creds = db_creds[node["rails_env"]]</p>

<p>template "#{app_dir}/shared/config/database.yml" do
  source "database.yml.erb"
  variables(</p>

<pre><code>:rails_env =&gt; node["rails_env"],
:username =&gt; env_db_creds["username"],
:password =&gt; env_db_creds["password"]
</code></pre>

<p>  )
end
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You've heard of Chef, Puppet, and other frameworks that can help you build out your infrastructure. You've been meaning to play around with one or more of them for some time now. Now's your chance; Start cooking up on your own servers!</p>

<p>In this presentation, I provide an introduction to Chef with a focus on what you'll need to know to get a Rails application up and running.</p>

<p>Topics include:
  * Introduction to Chef
  * Nodes, roles, environments, and other terminology
  * Introduction to cookbooks
  * Provisioning an environment for a Rails application
  * Deploying with Capistrano</p>

<p>You won't be ready to compete in Iron Chef, but you will be ready to serve up your own Rails environment in no time.</p>

<p>I gave slightly different versions of this presentation at <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation 2012</a> and <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate any comments, questions, or feedback in the comments section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>, I gave a presentation on how the <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> web operations team enables developer productivity.</p>

<p>There's always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we've made to our teams, processes and tools.</p>

<p>Presenting at RailsConf was a really enjoyable experience and the presentation was well received.  There were lots of questions from the audience after the presentation.  Unfortunately, the Q &amp; A section was not captured in the video.  I'd really appreciate any questions or feedback you have, just drop a comment below.</p>
