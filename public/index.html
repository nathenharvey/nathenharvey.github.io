  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/green-screen/">previous post</a>, I introduced Green Screen, a build monitoring tool that is designed to be used as a dynamic Big Visible Chart (BVC) in your work area.  It lets you add links to your build servers and displays the largest possible information on a monitor so that the team can see the build status from anywhere in the room.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to get Green Screen up and running on your own server or VM. The project&#8217;s README includes all the information you&#8217;ll need for doing so. In this post, I&#8217;ll describe the steps necessary to run Green Screen on Heroku or on your own server using Chef.</p>

<h2>Deploying to Heroku</h2>

<p>Deploying to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is probably the easiest way to get up and running with Green Screen. You&#8217;ll need a Heroku account but a free one should be sufficient. Check the <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart">quick start guide</a> if you don&#8217;t yet have an account.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your Heroku account set-up, simply follow these steps to get your Green Screen app deployed:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:customink/greenscreen.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd greenscreen</code></li>
<li><code>gem install heroku</code></li>
<li><code>heroku create</code></li>
<li><code>git push heroku master</code></li>
<li><code>heroku open</code></li>
</ol>


<p>If your build servers are running on the Internet, Heroku may be all that you need.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong> this default Green Screen looks at all of the builds currently running on <a href="http://ci.jenkins-ci.org">http://ci.jenkins-ci.org</a>.  This is fine for demo purposes but you may find it to be a bit overwhelming since it&#8217;s <strong>over 300 builds</strong> at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>You can see a sample of this app running at <a href="http://greenscreenapp.com">http://greenscreenapp.com</a></p>

We use Green Screen at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> to look after our continuous integration servers, currently 3 Hudson servers and one Jenkins cluster. We have a monitor mounted in the engineering office that makes it easy for everyone to quickly assess the build status.</p>

<p>Green Screen is a simple Sinatra application that is <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/01/02/deploying-green-screen">easy to configure and deploy</a>.  It works well with any continuous integration server that conforms to the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CI/Multiple+Project+Summary+Reporting+Standard">multiple project summary reporting standard</a>.</p>

I&#8217;ve recently switched my blog from <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. After working with Blogger, WordPress, and TypePad I&#8217;ve found that the Octopress works best for my personal blog.</p>

<p>Creating and editing posts in a text editor instead of a browser is a step-saver for me.  Previously I always worked with a local copy of each article and would cut-n-paste between my text editor and the browser.</p>

<p>The rake- and git-based workflow feels very natural.  After all, this is a &#8220;blogging framework for hackers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The standard layout and plugins are working well for me with little customization.</p>

<p>Deploying is a snap. I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> to host the blog but could just as easily be using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github:pages</a>.</p>

<p>The simplicity and familiar workflow really make for an excellent blogging platform! Thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/imathis">@imathis</a> for giving us <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/mongosv-2011">MongoSV</a>, <a href="http://10gen.com">10gen</a> presented awards to peer-nominated community members for their contributions to the MongoDB project.</p>

<p>There were <a href="http://blog.10gen.com/post/12290733213/mongodb-community-awards-to-be-presented-at-mongosv">3 different categories</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Innovative Application Award</strong> - recognizes a company or individual who has built an innovative application using MongoDB.</li>
<li><strong>Core Contributor Award</strong> - recognizes a community member for significant contribution to the codebase of the MongoDB core server, language drivers, or tools.</li>
<li><strong>Community Champion Award</strong> - recognizes an individual for their efforts evangelizing and growing the MongoDB community.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is the first year that 10gen has organized these awards. I think they&#8217;re a great way to recognize the contributions made by a few members of the community. I hope a significant portion of people in the community took the time to nominate or vote for another individual.  I suspect more community members will participate and 10gen will do a more to advertise the program in years to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was selected to share some of my experience with MongoDB at MongoSV.</p>

<blockquote><p>MongoSV is an annual one-day conference in Silicon Valley dedicated to the open source, non-relational database MongoDB. The comprehensive agenda includes 50+ sessions covering topics for both the novice and experienced user, with presentations from 10gen engineers as well as MongoDB users.</p><footer><strong>10gen</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.10gen.com/events/mongosv-2011'>MongoSV 2011</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Impressions and Observations</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://nathenharvey.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/images/mongosv.jpg" width="400" height="299" title="MongoSV" alt="MongoSV">
I&#8217;ve been to a few other similar MongoDB events in NYC and DC but this was the largest by far.  There were over 1,000 attendees and 5 tracks plus whiteboard and birds of a feather sessions.</p>

<h3>Schema free != Design free</h3>

<p>As freeing as a document store is, there&#8217;s still work to be done in designing how you&#8217;ll store and retrieve your data. It&#8217;s super-easy to get up and running without giving this much thought but you <em>will</em> need to design your documents eventually. There were at least 3 sessions about schema design during MongoSV.</p>

<h3>Aggregation Framework</h3>

<p>The new aggregation framework is great, highly anticipated, and much needed. During the Keynote, <a href="http://twitter.com/eliothorowitz">Eliot Horowitz</a> demonstrated an application built on MonogDB that used the Twitter API to capture tweets related to the day&#8217;s events. The demo site ran throughout the day and was used in a contest to see who tweeted the most about the conference and who was mentioned most. The source code for the app was subsequently made available on <a href="https://github.com/erh/mongosv-twitter-demo">github</a>. Check out <a href="http://twitter.com/cwestin63">Chris Westin</a>&#8217;s  presentation on <a href="http://www.10gen.com/presentations/mongosv-2011/mongodbs-new-aggregation-framework">MongoDB&#8217;s New Aggregation Framework</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shortly before <a href="http://blog.10gen.com/post/13885501875/announcing-the-mongodb-masters">MongoSV 2011</a>, 10gen announced the <a href="http://blog.10gen.com/post/13885501875/announcing-the-mongodb-masters">MongoDB Masters</a> Program.</p>

<blockquote><p>The MongoDB Masters program is designed to recognize the achievements of leaders in the community and enable the exchange of knowledge between and among 10gen and the community.</p><footer><strong>10gen</strong> <cite><a href='http://blog.10gen.com/post/13885501875/announcing-the-mongodb-masters'>Announcing the MongoDB Masters</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I am honored to be counted among such a <a href="http://wiki.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MongoDB+Masters">great group of MongoDB enthusiasts</a>. I was selected to join the Masters primarily because of my work with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group/">Washington DC MongoDB User Group</a> which I&#8217;ve been helping to organize for almost a year. The group has monthly meetings at <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>&#8217;s headquarters in Tysons, VA.</p>

<p>The day before MongoSV, most of the MongoDB Masters met for the inaugural Masters Summit. The Masters Summit was run like an &#8220;un-conference&#8221;; the members decided on topics and broke into discussion groups to cover each topic. There were also a number of lightning talks.</p>

<p>We had break-out groups on 16 different topics including</p>

<ul>
<li>Operations, hosting, and production architecture</li>
<li>Drivers</li>
<li>MongoDB and Windows</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2011/12/13/tips-for-hosting-a-tech-user-group/">previous post</a>, I gave some <a href="http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2011/12/13/tips-for-hosting-a-tech-user-group/">ideas about how to run a successful user group meeting</a>. In this post, I&#8217;ll focus on the actual meeting format we typically use for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group/">Washington DC MongoDB Users Group</a>. You may find that this format works well for any technical user group.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve experimented with a couple of different formats but I think we&#8217;ve settled into something that generally works for us. Some of these don&#8217;t work with a meeting that&#8217;s larger than 20 people; adjust accordingly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In January of 2011, I started hosting a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group/">monthly MongoDB meetup</a>. My employer, <a href="http://www.customink.com/">CustomInk</a>, was looking for ways to become better known in the local DC technology market. We were also just getting started with our initial production deployment of MonogoDB. Having engineers from the area come to our office, get to know CustomInk, and share their experiences with using MongoDB was a great opportunity!</p>

<p>Before I get much further, I&#8217;d like to give a hat tip to those user groups and podcasts that I learned from and stole ideas from. Namely, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/">DC RUG</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/">B&#8217;more on Rails group</a>, and the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/">Ruby Rogues podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Having a good space for hosting these types of meetings is important. CustomInk has two different spaces that we can utilize. The Parlour is a very cozy sitting room that includes a fireplace. It&#8217;s suitable for a groups of up to 30 people. The Cafe is quite a bit larger, we can host up to 80 people there. We also have a very nice outdoor patio which could hold 80 people but planning weather-dependent meetings doesn&#8217;t feel like the right way to go. The patio is connected to both the Parlour and the Cafe so networking at the beginning of the meeting sometimes happens there.</p>

<p>Our success hosting the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group/">MongoDB User Group</a> has led to us hosting a number of other meetups. We are the regular host for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/">DevOps DC</a> meetup and have hosted events for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ncagtug/events/17035395/">Android application development</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/R-users-DC/events/37862562/">R user group</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NoVa-Javascript-Ext-JS-Users-Group/events/36841452/">JavaScript user group</a>, and a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TwitterTeaTimeDC/events/38265862/">Twitter API meetup</a>.</p>

<p>The MongoDB group now includes over 250 members and the DevOps DC group is over 100. Based on our experience, I believe there are a number of things that you can do to grow and run a successful meetup group.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2011-11-21T04:48:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 21<span>st</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s Thanksgiving week. That means it&#8217;s time to start prepping your turkey.</p>

<p>In my opinion there are <strong>three very important things required for a terrific turkey</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a fresh turkey, I get mine from <a href="http://www.maplelawn.com/">Maple Lawn Farms</a>.</li>
<li>Brine the turkey (for 12-24 hours)</li>
<li>Once it&#8217;s in the oven, leave it alone!</li>
</ol>


<p>I always prepare mine in an apple cider brine:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 cups apple cider</li>
<li>2/3 cup kosher salt</li>
<li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns, coarsely crushed</li>
<li>1 tablespoon whole allspice, coarsely crushed</li>
<li>8 (1/8-inch-thick) slices peeled fresh ginger</li>
<li>6 whole cloves</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 (12-pound) fresh or frozen turkey, thawed</li>
<li>2 oranges, quartered</li>
<li>6 cups ice</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, this is for a 12-pound turkey, adjust for the size of your turkey.</p>

<h3>To prepare brine</h3>

<ul>
<li>combine first 8 ingredients in a large saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Cook 5 minutes or until sugar and salt dissolve.</li>
<li>Cool completely.</li>
</ul>


<h3>To prepare the turkey</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove giblets and neck from turkey.</li>
<li>Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry.</li>
<li>Trim excess fat.</li>
<li>Stuff body cavity with orange quarters.</li>
</ul>


<p>You&#8217;ll need something to to store the turkey in while it brines. Brine bags are relatively easy to find. They can be a bit messy to deal with so you might just use a large stockpot or a bucket. The important things are that the turkey is fully submersed in the brine and that you keep the whole thing cold throughout the process.</p>

<p>Place the turkey in the brine bag or other vessel of your choice and cover with the liquid. Place all of that into a cooler and fill with ice or place it into your refrigerator, if you have the room. Leave the turkey in the brine for 12-24 hours, turning occasionally.</p>

<h3>Cooking the turkey</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove the turkey from the brine</li>
<li>Discard the brine and orange quarters</li>
<li>Rinse the turkey and pat it dry</li>
</ul>


<p>Cook the turkey as you normally would. I like to start it breast side down for the first 30 minutes at a higher temperature (475&ordm; - 500&ordm;) then flip it over and reduce the heat to 350&ordm; for the remainder. If possible, use a <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/digital-voice-alert-thermometer/?pkey=x%7C4%7C1%7C%7C4%7Cmeat%20thermometer%7C%7C0&amp;cm_src=OLDLINK">leave-in thermometer</a> so that you don&#8217;t have to continually open the oven to check the temperature of the turkey.</p>

<p>Once the turkey is done cooking, be sure to let it rest at least 20 minutes before carving.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/mongosv-2011">MongoSV</a> is an annual one-day conference in Silicon Valley dedicated to the open source, non-relational database MongoDB. The comprehensive agenda includes 50+ sessions covering topics for both the novice and experienced user, with presentations from 10gen engineers as well as MongoDB users.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m one of the MongoDB users who will be speaking at the conference. The title of my talk is &#8221;<strong>MongoDB at CustomInk - Adoption, Operations, and Community</strong>&#8221;</p>

<p>In this talk I&#8217;ll detail some of the reasons we decided to go with MongoDB, the challenges we faced bringing it into the organization, how we&#8217;re using it in production today, lessons learned, and some of our future plans. The talk will also describe some of the operational considerations for putting MongoDB into production: how do we deploy, operate, and monitor MongoDB. During this talk I&#8217;ll also describe <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a>&#8217;s involvement in the MongoDB community.</p>

<p>Since January, CustomInk has been hosting the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group">Washington DC MongoDB Users Group</a>. I&#8217;ll share some of my experience with, tips for, and lessons learned growing a monthly user group.</p>

<p>The talk will be a refreshed and expanded version of the presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodc-2011">MongoDC</a> back in June. You can find <a href="http://speakerrate.com/events/985-mongodc">slides and reviews from MongoDC on SpeakerRate</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen</a> does a great job with these conferences. They&#8217;re always packed full of great information and you&#8217;ll get to meets lots of people from the community. MongoSV is the largest of these one-day conferences that 10gen organizes. This year, the conference also includes the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNvYzNpY3BTMHFrZWRVLVpuTktoSmc6MQ">MongoDB Community Awards</a> where you can nominate someone in three different categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Innovative Application</li>
<li>Community Champion</li>
<li>Contributor</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&#8217;re in Santa Clara on December 9th, or need a reason to be, be sure to stop by MongoSV. I have a discount code I can share with you to lower the cost of admission significantly, just let me know if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
