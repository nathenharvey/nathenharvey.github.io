    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started working with Chef, there were a couple of areas that I knew were going to be really awesome and helpful but I wasn&#8217;t sure how to get started with them.  In this presentation, I&#8217;ll provide a quick introduction to five things you&#8217;ve always wanted to know about Chef but were afraid to ask.</p>

<p>I gave this presentation at <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>Level-up your Chef skills by learning about these areas of Chef:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Attribute Precedence</strong> - Role, environment, cookbook, data bag? Which attribute value will be used in my chef run?</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Databags</strong> - Chef 0.10 brought us encrypted databags. We&#8217;ll look at how to create and use databags and how to keep them up-to-date in your repository.</li>
<li><strong>LWRP</strong> - What is a LWRP? How and why do you create one? We&#8217;ll look at a couple of sample LWRPs and learn how to build a simple one.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handlers</strong> - Demystify exception and report handlers by writing a simple one and seeing examples of how they work in the wild.</li>
<li><strong>Capistrano and Chef</strong> - Take a quick look at why and how to integrate Chef search into your Capistrano configuration to make deploying your Rails apps even easier.</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t mention in the presentation was how to use the data from the encrypted data bag.  I&#8217;ve updated the slides to include this info but it doesn&#8217;t appear in the video.  In any case, here&#8217;s a quick demo of how you might use it:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">creds = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load("db", "creds")
env_db_creds = db_creds[node["rails_env"]]

template "#{app_dir}/shared/config/database.yml" do
  source "database.yml.erb"
  variables(
    :rails_env =&gt; node["rails_env"],
    :username =&gt; env_db_creds["username"],
    :password =&gt; env_db_creds["password"]
  )
end
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve heard of Chef, Puppet, and other frameworks that can help you build out your infrastructure. You&#8217;ve been meaning to play around with one or more of them for some time now. Now&#8217;s your chance; Start cooking up on your own servers!</p>

<p>In this presentation, I provide an introduction to Chef with a focus on what you&#8217;ll need to know to get a Rails application up and running.</p>

<p>Topics include:
  * Introduction to Chef
  * Nodes, roles, environments, and other terminology
  * Introduction to cookbooks
  * Provisioning an environment for a Rails application
  * Deploying with Capistrano</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t be ready to compete in Iron Chef, but you will be ready to serve up your own Rails environment in no time.</p>

<p>I gave slightly different versions of this presentation at <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation 2012</a> and <a href="http://chefconf.opscode.com">#ChefConf 2012</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really appreciate any comments, questions, or feedback in the comments section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>, I gave a presentation on how the <a href="http://www.customink.com">CustomInk</a> web operations team enables developer productivity.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s always a bit of tension when getting features from idea to production. In this talk, I describe some of the changes CustomInk has made to reduce this friction and keep the new features coming. Gone are the days of bi-monthly deploys, office pools dedicated to guessing when this deploy will be rolled back, and the ceremony surrounding the deploy-rollback-fix-deploy cycle. Today, ideas flow from product managers to developers to production with ease thanks to a number of changes that we&#8217;ve made to our teams, processes and tools.</p>

<p>Presenting at RailsConf was a really enjoyable experience and the presentation was well received.  There were lots of questions from the audience after the presentation.  Unfortunately, the Q &amp; A section was not captured in the video.  I&#8217;d really appreciate any questions or feedback you have, just drop a comment below.</p>
