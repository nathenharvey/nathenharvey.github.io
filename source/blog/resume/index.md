# Work History

### CustomInk
Web Operations Manager - December 2009 - Present

Work proactively to solve challenges associated with growing, high-volume, consumer facing Web applications. Support and build out the next generation of our infrastructure while managing and improving our current assets.

* **Organizational development** - 
The operations team has grown three-fold since I joined CustomInk and the size of the engineering team as more than doubled. I help set the tone of the organization pushing for collaboration, constant learning, and continuous improvement.

* **Continuous deployment** - 
We've increased our deployment frequency from once every two weeks to five to ten times a day.

* **Automation** -
Our infrastructure is managed with Chef.  Giving us the ability to quickly spin-up new environments or expand capacity.

* **Developer Support** - 
As we continue to mature our infrastructure and automation, we are driving towards a self-service environment for developers.  From provisioning of environments to continuous integration configuration to self-service deploys, there are lots of things we're doing to improve the agility of our engineering team.

* **Production Support** - 
Although the t-shirt business seems relatively straightforward, we have over thirty applications running in production.  My team and I take primary responsibility for ensuring those applications are up, responsive, and working properly.

* **Sharing with the Community** - 
Part of improving our team is sharing both the good and the bad with the community.  I [contribute regularly to the CustomInk Technology blog](http://technology.customink.com/blog/our-team/nathen-harvey.html) and speak at technical conferences regularly.
