Part 3 of our Learning Chef tutorial was run as a Google+ Hangout that was streamed to YouTube.

In Part 3, we added a bunch of cookbooks from the community site including [git](http://ckbk.it/git), [application](http://ckbk.it/application), and [application_ruby](http://ckbk.it/application_ruby).  After adding these cookbooks, we created a cookbook of our own to deploy a [sample Rails application](https://github.com/mulderp/chef-demo).

The application wasn't fully deployed by the end of the tutorial but we'll pick-up from there next time.

I'll update this post soon with a breakdown of each step we took during this session.  In the meantime, you can watch the entire video below.
