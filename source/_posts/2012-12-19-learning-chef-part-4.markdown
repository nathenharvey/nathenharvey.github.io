## Learning Chef Series

* [Part 1](http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/06/learning-chef-part-1/) - Introduce the project, configure workstation, and register a node with hosted Chef
* [Part 2](http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/07/learning-chef-part-2/) - Download cookbooks from the community site, add MongoDB, Apache, and Passenger to our node
* [Part 3](http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/14/learning-chef-part-3/) - Start writing a cookbook to deploy our application
* [Part 4](http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2012/12/19/learning-chef-part-4/) - Finish the application deploy, introduce roles

Part 4 of our Learning Chef tutorial was run as a Google+ Hangout that was streamed to YouTube.

In Part 4, we completed the application deploy and then looked at [roles](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_roles.html).

I'll update this post soon with a breakdown of each step we took during this session.  In the meantime, you can watch the entire video below.

Also, you can grab the code from the following repositories on github:

* [Chef Repository](http://github.com/mulderp/learning-chef)
* [Rails Application](http://github.com/mulderp/chef-demo)

## What's Next

In Learning Chef - Part 5 we will move the MongoDB to it's own VM.
