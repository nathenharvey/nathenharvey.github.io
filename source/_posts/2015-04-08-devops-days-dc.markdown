DevOps is a cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high velocity organizations, born from the experiences of its practitioners.  

Since 2009, DevOps practitioners have been gathering for locally organized conferences known as DevOps Days.  We will be hosting [DevOpsDays DC on June 11 and 12](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-washington-dc/). 

I'd like to invite you to join us for DevOps Days DC as a speaker, participant, and DevOps enthusiast.  The [call for presenters (CFP)]((https://devopsdaysdc2015.busyconf.com/proposals/new) is open through April 15. We are seeking presenters from the public and private sector working within 100 miles of DC who are eager to share their experiences with adopting DevOps practices in their organization.
