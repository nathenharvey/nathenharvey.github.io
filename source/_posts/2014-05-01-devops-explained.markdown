We created a little video to help explain DevOps.  This video was initially released during [\#ChefConf 2014](http://chefconf.com).  

Please note, this video does include some explicit language.  However, there is a [version that's safe for all audiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-BF0z7eFoU).
